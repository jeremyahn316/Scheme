# Scheme

This project was created as a part of CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs using Python and Scheme.

In this project, developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. Was required to think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. This project only included a subset of the language and thus the interpreter does not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters.

Also implemented some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. Was able to cleanly transfer much of my understanding of Python to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.
